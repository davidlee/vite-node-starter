TypeScript: A Dungeon Adventure
----

Congratulations! You thought we had a boring interview planned for you, but today we're going to make a game!

Well, part of a game. We won't finish.

The style of game is a [Roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike). It'll look something like
[this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Rogue_Screenshot.png) - a top down dungeon 
made out of ASCII symbols. 

Some defining features of a roguelike:
 - The game uses random dungeon generation, to increase replayability.
 - Death is permanent. Save games don't allow you to recover previous state.
 - It's turn based, not real-time: the world only updates in response to player input.
 - It has a non-modal interface. Every action is available whatever the game / UI state (although it may not succeed)
 - It has complexity arising from the interaction of systems. There's more than one way to accomplish a goal. 
 - Resource management is important.
 - Hack and slash combat is ultra important.
 - A lot of what you discover is consistent within one "run" but will be randomly regenerated if you die. 
   Just because drinking a green potion heals you now doesn't mean it won't turn your next character into a statue.

## What we care about

You won't have to type. You'll be pairing with another developer, and be "navigating" - you direct them, talk aloud through the 
problems you encounter and potential solutions.

We want to get a sense of how you think, how you solve problems, how you like working with other developers, and how you communicate.

We don't expect you to finish the game, or even necessarily complete a feature. 

Have fun, and enjoy the process! We want to enjoy work, and hope you do too.
